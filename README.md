# contact-manager
This is a Contact Manager project with OneToOne & ManyToOne mapping.
###
simple crud example.

This project uses these technologies:
`1- Spring boot
2- Spring security
3- Spring Data Jpa
4- MySQL
5- Thymeleaf
6- Html/csffsf/bootstrap/js
7- Hibernate validator`

note that my focus was on the back-end side and the security part so the front-end is kind of... dull.
